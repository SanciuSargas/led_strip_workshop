# led_strip_workshop
This repostiroy contains material for a beginner workshop using addressable led strips.

Example workshop agenda:
- Presentation (TODO: add presentation)
- Going through code examples:
  - single_led_strip (simplest code to get the led strip to work)
  - multiple_led_strips (shows how to get 2 or more led strips to work at the same time)
  - multiple_led_strips_non_blocking_wait (explains the downside of using delays and a show a solution)
  - simple_serial (shows a way to easily debug code)
  - task_broken_code (an exercise which uses everything learned from the previous examples, contains hints)
- Hands on practice
